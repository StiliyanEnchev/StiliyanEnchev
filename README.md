👨‍💻 Python explorer | 🏗️ Builder of apps | 💾 Backend & frontend tinkerer

Over the past couple of years, I’ve leveled up from Programming Basics to Advanced Python, Django, PostgreSQL, and even HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I’ve also dabbled in Software Engineering and DevOps, so I get how all the pieces fit together.

I love turning ideas into real projects, experimenting with new tech, and having fun while coding.
